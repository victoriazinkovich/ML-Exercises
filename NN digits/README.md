Much of the information given below is taken from the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" written by **Michael Nielsen**. Ref: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html

The idea is to recignize the following pattern automatically:

To recognize individual digits we will use a three-layer neural network.

The input layer of the network contains neurons encoding the values of the input pixels. The input pixels are greyscale, with a value of 0.0 representing white, a value of 1.0 representing black, and in between values representing gradually darkening shades of grey.
